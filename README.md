## A Guide Book to the Data Industry

* Introduces programmers to data science concepts and practices through new
apparatuses such as R programming and data processing techniques
* Explains prevalent programming languages and data processing systems that
are commonly used to address engineering challenges
* Explores new tools and libraries to use in big data projects
* Presents principles that can be employed in applications ranging from
software simulations to real-world web applications that serve millions of
users
* Contains a plethora of examples used to explain various interconnected
concepts; most of the code samples on this website are __editable__
and __runnable__ in an interactive web-based IDE; for example, try editing
[this code snippet](https://tech.io/playground-widget/17892943edf13cf159936a03cd286a8442992/surface-plots/506728) then run it.

You may also choose to
[run code samples using our Docker images](https://computingwithdata.com/reader-resources/docker.html),
which come with dependencies, tools, and code samples pre-installed.

_Computing with Data_ introduces basic computing skills designed for industry
professionals without a strong computer science background. Written in an easily
accessible manner, it serves as a self-study guide to survey data science and
data engineering for those who aspire to start a computing career or expand
on their current roles, in areas such as applied statistics, big data, machine
learning, data mining, and informatics. The authors draw from their combined
experience working at software and social network companies, on big data
products at several major online retailers, as well as their experience building
big data systems for an AI startup. Spanning from the basic inner workings
of a computer to advanced data manipulation techniques, this book opens doors
for readers to quickly explore and enhance their computing knowledge.

_Computing with Data_ comprises a wide range of computational topics essential
for data scientists, analysts, and engineers, providing them with the necessary
tools to be successful in any role that involves computing with data.
The introduction is self-contained, and chapters progress from basic hardware
concepts to operating systems, programming languages, graphing and processing
data, testing and programming tools, big data frameworks, and cloud computing.
The book is fashioned with several audiences in mind. Readers without a strong
educational background in CS — or those who need a refresher — will find
the chapters on hardware, operating systems, and programming languages
particularly useful.
