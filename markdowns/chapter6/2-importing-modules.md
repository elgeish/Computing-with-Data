# Importing Modules

A Python module is a code object loaded into the Python program by the process
of importing. Suppose we have a module file `my_vars.py`, the definitions in
this file can be accessed in a different file using the appropriate `import`
command:

@[]({"project": "py", "stubs": ["chapter6/importing-modules.py", "chapter6/my_vars.py"], "command": "python chapter6/importing-modules.py"})
